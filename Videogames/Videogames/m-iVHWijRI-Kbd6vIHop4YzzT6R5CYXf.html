					<p style="margin-top: 0">
      What if you woke up one day, and you were a Pok&#233;mon? What if all of the 
      sudden you find yourself in a NEW world, where you can speak and 
      interact with other Pok&#233;mon? The adventure begins when you and your 
      partner Pok&#233;mon set out on rescue missions in a world ravaged by natural 
      disasters. But what is your true purpose and destiny in this Pok&#233;mon 
      world? That's the REAL mystery &#8230;
    </p>
				
				
   					<p>
      <b>Features</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An exciting and dramatic story pulls you into an involving world of 
        Pok&#233;mon never seen before
      </li>
      <li>
        Use various moves and items to complete your rescue missions and 
        increase your rescue team's reputation
      </li>
      <li>
        Meet more than 380 Pok&#233;mon on your journey. Become friends with them 
        and call upon them for help whenever you need to
      </li>
      <li>
        Strategic battles enhance the adventure as you explore deep dungeons 
        and towering mountains
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The contents of Pok&#233;mon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue 
      Team are about the same, but there are a few differences. There are 
      several DS-specific features of Pok&#233;mon Mystery Dungeon that you'll be 
      able to enjoy only when playing Blue Rescue Team, such as a dual-screen 
      view, touch-screen control and wireless connectivity. So, if you've been 
      waiting to pick up a Nintendo DS, there's no better time than right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>You come to the rescue!<br /></b>Many Pok&#233;mon are in danger as natural 
      disasters are devastating the land, and it's up to you, in your new 
      Pok&#233;mon body, to form a rescue team. To find the truth behind all these 
      disasters, you will need to explore one dank dungeon after the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there are no trainers around, you will need to lead your team in 
      battles, but your team members aren't as apt to follow your orders as 
      they would a trainers. No trainers means no Pok&#233;balls. So, to get other 
      Pok&#233;mon to join your rescue team, you'll need to find ways to coerce 
      Pok&#233;mon to join your side. The more rescues you make, the better your 
      Rescue Team ranking. Your ranking can influence whether Pok&#233;mon agree to 
      join your group or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Journey in the dungeon<br /></b>Dungeons are unique. Every time you 
      enter a dungeon, it will have a new, randomly generated map. Item 
      locations, stairs and enemies will change their location each time you 
      explore. Don't bother going back and sketching where you found a rare 
      Pok&#233;mon: It won't be there the next time you explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fail in a dungeon, there are serious consequences. You'll lose 
      all your money, many of your items and experience you've gained during 
      your expedition. But don't worry -- just as other Pok&#233;mon have called 
      for your help, you can call for help from other Pok&#233;mon Mystery Dungeon 
      players. They can then go into the dungeon where you met your match to 
      rescue your party, allowing you to salvage the money, items and 
      experience you would have lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game system you're using determines your options for how to connect 
      the game versions. DS gamers can use the wireless mode; GBA users must 
      use the GBA Game Link Cable. You can always write down and exchange 
      Wonder Mail using a password system as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a new kind of Pok&#233;mon game, but many things remain the same as 
      in previous Pok&#233;mon RPGs, including the turn-based battles, diversity of 
      Pok&#233;mon and the moves they learn. The game provides all sorts of new 
      ways to confront your enemies. Your Pok&#233;mon still have their traditional 
      moves, but those moves have new traits that let you customize complex 
      strategies. You can link together moves and have them all execute in the 
      same turn! Although these moves cost more points, the turn-saving 
      combinations radically change how you view combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Visit Pok&#233;mon Square<br /></b>After you rescue Pok&#233;mon, head to 
      the Pok&#233;mon Square, which serves as a base for your operations. The 
      Pok&#233;mon-shaped buildings house all sorts of shops and services. Once you 
      establish a base, Pelipper will deliver missions for you to undertake. 
      You can buy items at the Kecleon Store, and Kangaskhan Storage is a 
      place that will hold on to your items while you're in a dungeon. If 
      you're looking to hone your fighting skills, go to Makuhita Dojo to get 
      in some practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than 380 kinds of Pok&#233;mon are available to travel with you, but 
      first you need to make sure they have a place to stay. For this, you 
      need to unlock a Friends Areas. You can go to the Wigglytuff Club to buy 
      entry to a Friends Area. Sometimes you'll earn entry to an area as a 
      reward or you can meet special Pok&#233;mon to unlock their Friends Area. 
      Once you've earned entry to a Friends Area, you can visit it and talk to 
      the Pok&#233;mon who have joined your party.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Features unique to Nintendo DS<br /></b>Although there are two similar 
      versions of Pok&#233;mon Mystery Dungeon for both Game Boy Advance and 
      Nintendo DS, the features of Blue Rescue Team for DS further enhance the 
      game's experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can control your team and access menus via the touch screen, view 
      your map in real-time on the top screen and connect wirelessly with 
      other players who have a copy of Pok&#233;mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue 
      Team. Another advantage to having a Nintendo DS is that you can trade 
      back and forth between Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team by inserting 
      the two games into the Nintendo DS's two game slots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay tuned for more information on Pok&#233;mon Mystery Dungeon as release 
      date approaches.
